# Conclusion

Over the course of the workshop you (hopefully) learned a lot!

You set up your own, local cluster, consisting of **multiple nodes** and a working connection to/from your local machine. You also **deployed** your first **workloads** onto said cluster, going from **pod** to **deployment** and even learning about **scaling** and **updating** them!

You also learned about **networking**, going from fundamentals on the **pod network level** on to establishing connectivity from clients **outside of the cluster**, either via **port**, **load balancer IP**, or **Ingress**.

If you want to dive deeper into the Kubernetes universe now, there are a few places to go from here, depending on what/how you want to learn:

- the [Kubernetes documentation](https://docs.kubernetes.io) is a great place to continue. You can find all sorts of content there, from **tutorials** to **introductions** to **deep dives** revolving around certain parts of the technology

- the [CNCF Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/) is *the* **community** for Kubernetes, its different **use-cases** and **related projects**. You can find **mentors** and **like-minded people** there, ask questions, and continue exploring.

I also plan on extending this workshop over time - from `Secrets` and `ConfigMaps` onwards to `PersistentVolumes` and cluster security. Whenever I will finish a new section, there will be a **new release** on GitHub, so now's your chance to **star the repository** if you're interested in following along (You can find the repository link in the top right corner of the page)!

If there's a **certain topic** you want to see rather sooner than later, feel free to **open an issue**! Of course, you can do the same if you found a **typo, wrong information** (hopefully not), or had **problems with parts** of the workshop.
